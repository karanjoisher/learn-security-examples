Tampering refers to modifying code or data through unsecure access points within the application which can compromise the privacy and security of the application.

In this vulnerability, the server accepts any string input from the user. The server then uses the same string to render elements within an HTML object.
As a result, any string provided by the user will be executed by the browser as part of the DOM processing.
Attacker can inject <script> objects within the DOM which would then be executed by the browser and can compromise the security of the application.
