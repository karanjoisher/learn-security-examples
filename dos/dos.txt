- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
In the insecure version, an attacker can pass malicious input that can cause the server to crash upon receiving the request.
This can be triggered accidentally too by an actual user of the application. To protect against server crash (and as a result, denial of service),
the server implements proper error handling using try catch blocks which prevents any service outages due to invalid inputs.


- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
To prevent DoS and DDoS, we can implement rate limiting and route API requests through Content Delivery Network.
